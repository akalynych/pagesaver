### PAGESAVER

a demo can be seen here: https://pagesaver.dweb.tools

Enter a URL and press enter. The resulting links are copies of the page, except that they are hosted on IPFS.
You can also enter youtube URLs.


###
NOTES:
- Please check local ipfs node for peers (http://localhost:5001/webui/#/peers), if you do not have any peers, then resulting links will not work because your node needs to be able to transfer the data to another peer. All you need to do is wait about 1 or 2 minutes for your ipfs node to boostrap and find peers, about 100 peers is good enough for the URLs to get "warmed" properly.

###
TODO:
- (monoltih) disable javascript for certain sites, (medium.com, reddit,) 
- cleanup youtube support
- add bandcamp support
- clean up embedded ipfs, make better
- fix html pages, perhaps ask someone in community
